Amber, Owner of Lead Me Home Rescue stepped up and helped us find great homes for them. Since then, I have dog sat, that turned into fostering. As I dog sat and fostered for Lead Me Home, Amber and I became good friends. Now we are two of a kind... Seriously we are... two of a kind. We help each other any time one of us needs the help. I have learned a few things from her and I am grateful that she stepped up when she did. We are best friends now. I will always help her with her rescue. I sincerely believe in what she is doing and the many things she has accomplished in a year of having the rescue. Thank you Amber for being a light for the dogs that could not see it. Also, Thank you for being a great friend!"
