## Refund Policy
When you sign up for this program, you are holding a spot on our calendar to provide the best service possible to you. We hope you'll take advantage of our time together, but if you do not, we unfortunately cannot provide a refund. We will work with you to the best of our ability to accommodate schedules to ensure you get the most out of this program.

To encourage commitment to training, refunds are not offered. In the unfortunate circumstance that your dog passes away, previously unused, paid training sessions will graciously be refunded.
