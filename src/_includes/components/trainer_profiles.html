            A lifetime passion, turned into a dream come true. I've always trained my
            personal dogs but never for anyone else, until the Rayco puppies. A liter of
            five puppies, turned into volunteering for Lead Me Home Rescue and training
            all the dogs I fostered. After serveral months and many dogs I decided to
            turn it into a business.

            I am located in Corinth, MS, where there are very few trainers avaliable. As
            of May 4, 2020, I am currently the only AKC evaluator in the area.
