        <p>A lifetime passion, turned into a dream come true. I've always trained my personal dogs but never for anyone else, until the Rayco puppies.
        A liter of five puppies, turned into volunteering for Lead Me Home Rescue and training all the dogs I fostered. After serveral months and many dogs
        I decided to turn it into a business.</p>
        <p>Located in Corinth, MS, there are very few trainers avaliable. I am currently working with AKC to hopefully be an AKC trainer and evaluator.</p>
