<h1>Board Training Transition Tips</h1>
<p>You got your puppy back home from board training. Congratulations! I know you are happy to have them back in your home, but we want to share with you a few tips that will make the transition a bit easier. The training process can be a bit overwhelming for both you and your puppy. There's a lot to learn and a lot to remember. For that reason - we want this to be a consolidation point of all the commands and other tips that we have given you over the last month. At some point, over the last month, we have told you pretty much everything in this article. And we hope that this will help answer any questions you might have during this time. If not, we are always here for you and your puppy.</p>

<h2>First Days Back Home</h2>
<p>The first three<small><small>(3)</small></small> days back home are considered <i>decompression days</i>. What this means is, "Your puppy needs time to adjust back into the new environment of your home". Remember, your puppy has lived with our family in our home for the last month. And when they came to us, we did not work with the puppy for at least the first three<small>(3)</small> days for this very reason. Some puppies make the transition back home quickly. Some take a little longer. But three<small>(3)</small> days is a good general rule of thumb.</p>

<p>During this time, be patient with your pup as it readjusts. You might have an accident or two<small>(2)</small> due to puppy needing to learn which door to go to and/or being excited. It's also common for puppies to test you every way they know how during this time. Such as, they might act like they have no idea what it means to sit or stay. They might bark at you excitedly or bark after you put them in their crate.</p>

<p>Don't be afraid or let this scare you. Most, if not all dogs, do just fine going back home. They are just as glad to be there, with you, as you are to have them back. Most importantly... Be patient with them for at least the first three<small>(3)</small> days.</p>

<h2>Interactions with Children</h2>
<p>For those of you with children, supervise all interactions between the puppy and the children. Take the dog out of the situation if it becomes heated. Do not put the dog in the crate. Command the dog to "Leave it", so it will learn to avoid and ignore the children's behaviors. Kids will be kids and play very enthusiastically at times. This is perfectly normal and the puppy should learn to disengage and not become overly excited with them. Remember, puppies and dogs do not play the same as children.</p>

<h1>Daily Schedule</h1>
6:00 AM

- We wake up at 6 AM everyday. All puppies go outside to potty at this time. This does not take very long and they are ready to come back inside. Most mornings, the puppies will come back in and pile around. Sometimes they play at bit, amongst themselves. About 30-45 minutes later, we take them out once again just before feeding. In come cases, if you find that your puppy is not eating or whining when he/she shouldn't be - that is a very good sign that they did not potty while outside.

7:00 AM

- We bring the dogs in with a excited, "Let's eat!". We command each of the dogs to "Crate up!" and point them to their crates. Early on, it helps to stand next to the crate and simply point inside it while giving the command to "Crate up". We place the food on top of their crate and command the dogs to "Sit" before we give them their food. Once siting, we open the door and give the "Wait" command. They must allow you to place their food bowel in front of them without trying to touch it. If they do touch it or try to take it from you. Remove the bowel and close the door. This will most likely cause them to come out of the sitting position. At this point, start over and place the bowel of food back on top of the crate and command them to sit again. Once they allow you to place the bowel in the their crate, you can then close the door and allow your puppy to eat in peace. The purpose of this exercise to instill patience and respect towards you, as their Alpha. You are, in essence, sharing your food with them. So they can at least be polite and respectful about it.

7:15 AM

- After feeding, your puppy should lye in their crate patiently before you let them out to go potty, once again.

8:30 AM - 9:00 AM

- Typically, between 8:30 and 9 we start training sessions. All sessions start with a "Controlled Walk" with a length of approximately .6 miles. At the end of walk, we enter the front yard and start our session. At the end of the session - you got it, another opportunity to go potty.

11 AM - 4:30 PM

- After all training sessions are completed, the puppies are ready to come back inside and just pile around. This is their free time, if you will. Most days they all find either their crate or a placing mat and take a long nap. On most days, I take this opportunity to do the more advanced training with a few of the dogs and take one or two downtown or run some errands with me. Once back home, all dogs are let out again. Then it's back inside for some inside play or rest, if needed.

5:00 PM

- Afternoon feeding begins and the same exercise is completed as the morning feeding. Remember to always take your puppy out and give them the chance to potty at least 15 mins before feeding time.

10:00 PM

- We take all the dogs out 15 minutes before, to give them one last chance to potty for the day. Bedtime is announced by the call, "Time for bed!" while outside during their final potty. All the dogs run to the door, waiting to be let back in. Once inside, we give the "Crate up" command. Once crated, we place each of their favorite toys or items (keep on top of each respective crate) in the crate with them. We then command each dog to sit politely. Once seated, we give them one last treat for the day. We turn on DogTV Relaxation or some soft instrumental music and turn down the lights. We typically sit with them for a few minutes, just to make sure no one is having any issues and that everyone is calm. Then we leave the room and go to bed ourselves.

<h2>The Crate</h2>
<p>Your puppies crate is their "Safe Place" in your home. We have worked very hard to help make this happen for them. It should not be used as a correction or form of punishment, if at all possible. Doing so runs the risk of breaking that sense of safety for them and you might find that they no longer like being in their crate at all.</p>

<p>Aside from feeding time, all create doors are left open throughout the day. This make the puppies crate available to the them at all times. If a puppy enters another's crate, we give the "Out" command. That is, unless they are welcomed by the create owner. It is not uncommon that if two puppies bond or become playmates, they will not mind sharing their crate with them from time to time. But if any signs of aggression are given, we will step in to remove the intruder.</p>

<p>The puppies favorite toys and/or items are removed as soon as their crate doors are opened in the mornings for potty time and placed in their respective baskets above their crate. This helps to not only protect their toys and/or items from being taken by the other puppies, but it gives them something to look forward to or make them feel good about being in their crate at night.</p>

<p>If you do not use a crate or have a crate just yet, that's ok. Crates are not normally used throughout a dogs entire life. As the dog gets older, you might find that they naturally find a safe place somewhere else. Then again, we have a dog over 1yr old that will jump into a crate as soon as the doors are opened. The crate merely represents a place your puppy can go when he wants some alone time or he wants to feel safe. That space can be anywhere within your home, but more often than not it should be in an area where the rest of the family spends their time as well, such as a corner of your living room with a soft bed and a few toys.</p>

<p>If you find yourself wanting to use the crate as a way to keep the puppy or dog away from something or someone, may we suggest the following:
Setup an area or small mat next to were you sit during the day or at night when with other family members. Use a leash as a tether and tether the puppy to that seat or something close by. Close enough that they can lay on the mat close to you or your sitting area. Being pulled away from their pack/family is hard enough for them. But since they are able to sit by your area, it will make them feel much better about the situation.</p>

<section id="potty">
<h2>Potty Time</h2>
<p>As you might've noticed in the schedule above, we give ample opportunity for the puppies to go potty. This is very important! Especially during their early months. If they learn early on that outside is where that stuff happens, it becomes second nature really quick. The more chances they have to potty outside means less chances for them to potty inside.</p>

<p>When we take them outside to potty, we always give the potty command - "Let's potty!". If they seem more interested in a stick or playing with another puppy, we give the "Leave it" command and repeat the "Let's Potty" command. As puppies, they can become distracted very easily, so keeping them on task is very important. Then, when one of them does potty we make a big deal about it. We will say their name in a very excited voice and tell them, "Good potty!" and pet them several times.</p>

<p>When talking your dog anywhere with you, the first thing you should do after arriving, is take them to a safe place that they can use the bathroom and give the potty command. Every dog that leaves our board training program is very familiar with this routine.</p>
