<p>My story begins when I was about 5 years old. My Mom and I were given an older dog because the lady was moving and could not take the dog with her. Skeeter was her name. I think she was a Shih Tzu mix. She was my first dog. We had her for about a year and she had puppies, and I named them all after the Smurfs.  I was so in love with Skeeter and her puppies, that I cried when I came home one day, and they were all gone. I understand now, but back then I didn’t.  Not long after that I had my first seizure and was diagnosed with Epilepsy.
</p>
<p>Four years later, at the age of 8, my sister was given a puppy from one of my cousins. It was a little white ball of fluff that fit in the palm of my hand. Keep in mind, I was very little back then. So, the dog was surely little. It was right after my Grandmother had passed away. My sister, Sandra brought the puppy to show my Mom and I what she had. Sandra stayed a couple of days with us and during that time, I became attached to the dog. Even though Sandra was there, the puppy slept with me. I would not let it go. When it came time for sister to leave, my Mom told my sister… You can’t take the dog.  The dog makes Kim happy and I want her to keep it.  Lucky me, I got to keep the dog. Yes, crying was involved. Lol
</p>
<p>Her name was Wilma Jean, a Toy Poodle.  We were two peas in a pod. Everywhere I went, she went. Except school, but she was always waiting for me when I came home from School. I taught her to sit, lay down, dance for a treat, roll over, give paw and come when I called her. She slept with me and stayed right by me all the time. When Wilma was about 8 months old, I had a seizure and I remember waking up in the ambulance hearing her yelping and barking before I passed out again. The next thing I remember is waking up on the couch with my hand on the floor and Wilma had her head in my hand. My Mom told me; the dog stayed by my side the whole time I was out. The next time I had a seizure, she alerted my family members to what was happening.  I don’t remember having seizures or many days after. But what I do remember is Wilma Jean was always there before I had one and right there by my side when I would wake up. Wilma and I would go stay at my Dad’s house, so she knew the way… He lived across the highway from the neighborhood that my Mom and I lived in. So, one day, just being a kid that didn’t know any better, wrote a note for my Dad and tied it to Wilma’s collar. We went outside and I told her go give this to Daddy. Well, guess what? Fifteen minutes later here comes my Dad and Wilma Jean in the front seat. Both with the biggest smiles on their faces, yes dog included. I found the note years later after my Dad passed, he had kept it all these years.
</p>
<p>I had Wilma for 8 years. I stopped having seizures around the age of 13 or so. Wilma began to have seizures 2 years later. She was put on the same medication I was taking. She watched me have seizures for years and I felt so helpless when I witnessed her having seizures. I would cry every time. But unfortunately, the seizures took her. Wilma was a great companion and seizure alert dog. She would come every time I called her until the day, I called her, and she didn’t come.
</p>
<p>When I moved in with my Dad, there was a cat hanging out at his house. As we were moving my stuff in, the cat came in and had kittens under his bed. Ha! Later that night, Daddy woke me up saying he keeps hearing kittens, and so I looked under his bed and there they were, and the momma cat was at the door wanting in. Yes, you guessed it, I ended up with a kitten. She was a Calico cat. I named her Pasta. I would put her in my purse that I bought just for her and carried her everywhere.  The people in Wal-Mart called me the Cat Lady. I was 18 years old. Ha! Pasta stayed with me through 8 moves and various other things you will soon read about.  She was 18 years old when she passed away.  And yes, she also slept with me all those years. She was very loyal and one of the best cats we had.
</p>
<p>Fast forward 2 years later. We had a 4-month-old daughter and one night we kept hearing a puppy. On this night, there was 6 inches of ice and snow on the ground. My husband got up and went outside to look for the puppy we kept hearing, but couldn’t find. The next day we heard it again and Phillip was able to find the puppy in the snow.  When he brought it in, I immediately fell in love with the puppy. How could you not. It was a black lab. I put my 4-month-old daughter down on the floor to sit and play with her toys and Phillip put the dog on the floor. The dog ran circles around our daughter and she just started laughing so hard she fell over. The dog became known as Noodles. Yes, we were keeping our Italian food names.  We also had a Lasagna, Oregano and Basil. All cats who we dearly loved and had for a long time. 
</p>
<p>When our daughter was about 2, she had a seizure. Noodles wouldn’t leave her side. As with what happened to me and Wilma. Happened with my daughter and Noodles. Noodles became a seizure alert dog. I did however, train her to sit, stay, lay down, give paw, load and unload and come when called. She was a great dog.  Once our Daughter got older and started venturing out into the neighborhood, Noodles would follow her everywhere she went. All I had to do was call Noodles and she would come to the end of the driveway and look at me and go back to the door of the house that our daughter was at. Any time that Taylor was going to have a seizure, Noodles would not let her out of her sight and would act differently and I knew. Noodles and Taylor grew up together just as Wilma and I had. They were inseparable. Taylor stopped having seizures. unfortunately, Noodles became ill with Pancreatitis.  We had Noodles for 12 years.
</p>
<p>We had a second daughter as well and yes; she also had a dog of her own. Copper, the Fiest.  My sister gave her to me when our youngest daughter was 3 years old.  Of course, Copper started out sleeping with us, snuggling in between us to keep warm. After about 6 months, she started taking up with Sky, our youngest daughter. They became 2 peas in a pod as well. Everywhere Sky went, Copper would follow. Fortunately, Sky did not have seizures. But Copper was her best friend. Copper would let her dress her up and have teatime and play school with her. And yes, all I had to do was call Copper and she would come to the end of the driveway, wherever Sky was, look at me and then go back to the door of the house where she was. I also trained Copper basically the same commands as I did the other dogs. Back then I didn’t watch tv and we didn’t have internet and I just wanted her to do something, so I taught her what to do and what I expected. Copper was another great dog. More than that, they were all our family in fur and four paws. Copper ended up with congestive heart failure and we had to say goodbye to her in 2016. She was 8 years old. By this time, we had learned a few things about how vetting was important, shots, heartworm prevention and spaying, and all that.
</p>
<p>During the time that we had Noodles, Copper, Pasta and the other cats, we ended up with a rabbit. His name was Woofus, because that’s how the girls pronounced his name. It was cute. The rabbit ate cat food and used a litter box like the cats. It stayed inside the house and the dogs nor the cats bothered it but snuggled with it. We had that rabbit for 4 years. We were heartbroken when it passed away.
</p>
<p>Then Easter came one year, and my sister decides to give my two girls ducks for Easter as a gift.  Yes, that’s right Ducks! We had three little ducks in the house with the cats and the dogs, and everyone got along. What’s funny about the ducks is that they were supposed to be for the kids, well I ended up being their Momma duck. They had to be tucked in at night and at 6 in the morning, every morning, they would come quacking and pecking at my bedroom door. Haha I would get up and open the door and they would all get in a line and follow me to the pantry door where their food was kept. Yes, they would get excited. Quacking and pecking at the door. Then follow me to their food bowl for breakfast. During the day they followed me everywhere.  Once it warmed up outside, I put a little swimming pool on the deck and let them swim in it, they loved it.  Once summer came, I thought it was time to let them go.  We loaded them up and took them to my Mom’s house. She lived on the lake, and they would be happy with all the water and other ducks and geese.
</p>
<p>After the ducks, came a squirrel. A friend of mine found a squirrel nest in her dryer vent. They managed to get all the baby squirrels to go up the tree except for one. He just curled up in a ball. They called me and asked what to do.  I went over to her house, and when I looked at the squirrel, I picked it up and put it in my shirt pocket. He got comfy and stuck his head out. Well guess what, I have a squirrel now. I bring it home and just so happens that my Dad and sister are over visiting.  We had another rabbit that my Dad and I had built a cage for. So, I put the squirrel in the cage inside the house. I had internet at this time. I looked up information about squirrels, what to feed them and what not.  I wrapped him in a warm washcloth and bottle fed him and put him in the cage. I walked out of the room to go to the kitchen and the squirrel starts squeaking… loudly. Ha! My sister called me to come back to the living room and he stopped. I went back around the corner and he did it again. So, from then on, his name was squeaky! 
</p>
<p>Yes, at this time we still had Noodles, Copper, Pasta, Basil and a few other cats. All living in the same house getting along. Since he would squeak when I left the room, I just put him on my shoulder, and he would go under my hair and peak out on one side or the other.  Every morning when I would get up, I would go to his cage open the door and put my hand out. Squeaky would run up my arm and under my hair he would go.  When it started to get warmer, I would take him outside and put my hand against the tree and he would run up the tree and play and eat acorns and throw them at me. It was his way of playing. If I even thought of leaving his sight, he would start squeaking at me. So, when it was time to come in and get ready for the day, I would put my hand on the tree and call him. Squeaky would come running down the tree and under my hair he would go.  Once inside, I would let him run loose in the house and none of the other animals bothered him. But being a boy and all, he became a little protective of me and bit my husband while he was telling me bye one morning as he was leaving for work. I knew I couldn’t just let him go. He wasn’t wild anymore. We found someone who had recently lost a flying squirrel to old age and gave him to them. They gave him a truck to play with and he lived a good life without biting anyone.
</p>
<p>A couple of years after losing Noodles, we came across Mattie. The Miniature Schnauzer. In the Wal-Mart parking was a man selling puppies. Mattie was the only white one and was the runt of the liter. It was love at first sight.  Mattie reminded me of Wilma. So, I took the clearance puppy. Because he was white, he was less than the other ones. I didn’t care, I just wanted the dog. Mattie is now over 10 years old, a little grumpy, but a great snuggle buddy. He slept with us for 8 years and then decided he wanted to take up with Sky. He sleeps in her room now and she spoils him rotten. I also trained him as I did with all my other dogs, but this time, I leashed trained him. 
</p>
<p>June of 2019, Father’s Day weekend, our girls decided to catch some puppies that were behind RayCo. Out of a liter of 8, we ended up with 4 and five weeks later managed to catch another one.
</p>
<p>Pretzel was in this bunch and as soon as I laid eyes on him, it was love at first sight. I knew we didn’t need another dog. We were happy with Mattie. But there was just something about Pretzel that just drew me in. I fought it for two days of not wanting to keep him and people were asking if they could have him. Finally, I said he is mine and I shall call him Pretzel. 
</p>
<p>After a month, Amber Austin with Lead Me Home Rescue stepped in and found wonderful loving homes for the other ones. When they left, they were house broke and crate trained, leash trained and had basic obedience training, just like with my other dogs. Yes crying was involved, but to see the pictures of the adopters when they took the puppies my daughters’ rescued and take them into their arms with tears in their eyes, that they had fell in love with a dog from a picture and a few videos was very heartwarming. It made me want to do more, Since then, I have volunteered for Lead Me Home and fostered two hounds that were very unruly, but I managed to house and crate train, leash train and give them basic obedience training in 4 weeks.  Hazel was adopted first, then two weeks later Whitt followed.
</p>
<p>I also had the privilege to foster and train 2 Great Pyrenees puppies. One of which I had for three weeks and the other only a week. 
</p>
<p>All through this I researched the ever-growing therapy dog. I found a website for Pet Partners. As I was searching through the community and looking for other PP Therapy teams, I ran across Scott R. Wilson in Oxford, MS. Mr. Scott has become a wonderful mentor for me and taught me a lot. I did a registration for Pretzel and myself. We have been working hard at training. So far, he has the AKC STAR Puppy title and the AKC Canine Good Citizen title. Pretzel and I are currently working on the Urban CGC Title and after his 1st birthday, we are going for the AKC Therapy Canine and Pet Partners Evaluation.
</p>
<p>Through my research I came across Mississippi Therapy Canines and volunteered as a volunteer puppy raiser.  I received Chicken Noodle in November of 2019. Within 3 weeks of having her, she was trained to sit, stay, lay down, leash trained, come when called, and crate trained. It took a little longer to house train her though. She doesn't like the rain.  She was on the same level as Pretzel. They also know the leave it, halt, heel and wait commands. These two dogs, Pretzel and Chicken Noodle will be Therapy Canines. The more dogs I train the better I feel. I am helping a dog find their forever family.
</p>
<p>To say I love animals I guess would be an understatement. I haven’t met a dog or cat or any animal that didn’t like me or shy away from me.  I love working with animals and love to see animals make people smile and brighten their day.  All the animals we’ve had over the years will never be forgotten; they hold a place in our hearts forever. 
</p>
<p>Everything happens for a reason, and I am happy this has happened.<p>
<p>Thank you for reading this, I know it was long. But now you know the passion I have for animals has always been there and will forever be there.</p>
Sincerely,
