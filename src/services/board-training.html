<p>This service is for, but not limited to, puppies under the age of 6 months. It follows all [AKC STAR
    Puppy](https://www.akc.org/products-services/training-programs/canine-good-citizen/akc-star-puppy/) and [CGC -
    _(Canine
    Good Citizen)_](https://www.akc.org/products-services/training-programs/canine-good-citizen/take-the-test/)
    guidelines.
    Our Domestic Board Training Program also covers House and Crate Training, as well as Socialization and Social
    Desensitization sessions with your puppy. This includes visits to several pet friendly stores in our area along with
    pet
    friendly dining areas. At the end of the 4 week program, you and your puppy will/can be evaluated again _(free of
    charge)_ so he or she can receive their official AKC CGCA (AKC Community Canine) and/or AKC CGCU (Canine Good
    Citizen
    Urban) awards.</p>

<p>AKC Star Puppy and CGC are normally two or more separate six week courses, performed as Owner Assisted or Group
    Training. Since your puppy will be living as a member of our family, this allows us to take better advantage of
    their
    time here and use each and every moment as a teaching experience.</p>

<p>It's vital that we maintain the bond between you and your puppy. It's also important that you, as your puppies owner,
    learn along with your new friend. For these reasons, we require that you attend at least one 1 hr training session
    with
    your puppy a week during their time here. This not only allows you to spend time with your pet, but get an in-person
    view of their training progress. It also gives us a chance to help instruct you on how to use the commands that we
    are
    teaching your puppy and properly communicate with your new family member.</p>

<p>If your puppy requires a special dog food, you will be required to provide it. Otherwise, we use [Purina Pro Plan
    SAVOR](https://www.purina.com/pro-plan/dogs/dry-dog-food/savor-puppy-shredded-blend-chicken-rice-probiotics).</p>

<p>Per AKC standards, owners will be asked to provided vet records at time of evaluation. Those records will be required
    before being admitted into the program. Proof of flea and tick control, as well as heart worm prevention is also
    required. Monthly flea, tick and heartworm medications will gladly be administered at no additional fee, but the
    owner
    is asked to provide the medications. We understand that life can be quit hectic at times. For that reason, if you
    cannot
    get the medications from your vet, we will gladly take the dog for their visit at no charge. If we need to purchase
    the
    medications for your puppy, we will simply bill you for the cost of those medications on your next invoice. We will
    provide you a copy of the receipt from your vet as well. This is for the safety of all current and future puppies in
    the
    program.</p>
