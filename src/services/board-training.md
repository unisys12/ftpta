This service is for puppies between the age of 8 weeks and 6 months. It follows all [AKC STAR Puppy](https://www.akc.org/products-services/training-programs/canine-good-citizen/akc-star-puppy/) and [CGC - _(Canine Good Citizen)_](https://www.akc.org/products-services/training-programs/canine-good-citizen/take-the-test/) guidelines. Our Domestic Board Training Program also covers House and Crate Training.

AKC Star Puppy and CGC are normally two seperate six week courses, performed as Owner Assisted Training. Since your puppy will be living as a member of our family, this allows us to take better advantage of their time here and use each and every moment as a teaching experience.

It's vital to us that we maintain the bond between you and your puppy. It's also important to learn along with your new friend. For these reasons, we require that you attend at least one 1 hr training session with your puppy a week during their time here. This not only allows you to spend time with your pet, but get an in-person view of their training progress. It also gives us a chance to help instruct you on how to use the commands that we are teaching your puppy.

If your puppy requires a special dog food, you will be required to provide it. Otherwise, we use [Purina Pro Plan SAVOR](https://www.purina.com/pro-plan/dogs/dry-dog-food/savor-puppy-shredded-blend-chicken-rice-probiotics).

Per AKC standards, owners will be asked to provided vet records at time of evaluation. Those records will be required before being admitted into the program. Proof of flea and tick control, as well as heart worm prevention is also required. Monthly flea, tick and heartworm medications will gladly be administered at no additional fee, but the owner is required to provide the medications. This is for the safety of all the puppies currently in the program.
