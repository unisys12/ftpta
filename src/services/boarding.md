Boarding is where your puppy needs to stay with us overnight or for a few days. Since we are not a specialized boarding facility and our primary focus is on training, this is a very limited service, due to us needing to hold spots for our [Puppy Level One](/services/puppy-level-1-program "Puppy Level One Program") & [Puppy Level Two](/services/puppy-level-2-program "Puppy Level Two Program") premium services. This service is combined and priced separately with our [Day Care](/services/day-care).
