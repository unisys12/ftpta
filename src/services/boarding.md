Boarding is where your puppy needs to stay with us overnight or for a few days. Since we are not a specialized boarding facility and our primary focus is on training, this is a very limited service, due to us needing to hold spots for our [Frustrated to Fabulous](/services/frustrated "Frustrated to Fabulous Program") & [Chaos to Calm](/services/chaos "Chaos to Calm Program") premium services. This service is priced separately with our [Day Care](/services/day-care).
