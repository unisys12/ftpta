Our in-home Evaluation serves several purposes and is only required to be performed in one of our Board & Train Programs. Here how it works:

- We come to your home and perform an evaluation on your new puppy. 
    - This allows us to validate the issues that were discussed during our Discovery Call.
    - Allows us to meet the puppy on their terms and observe them in their normal day-to-day environment.
    - Allows you and your family to meet and get to know us better before you decided to board your dog with us. We firmly believe that meeting face to face, rather than just over the phone several times, makes for a better experience for everyone involved with the puppy. Building trust and making sure that you are comfortable with the decision is vital!
- Allows your puppy their first opportunity to meet each of our personal dogs, as well as any other dogs that are here at that time. No, we do not bring them with us, but we do have the smell of each one on us from working with them throughout the day.
- This is also treated as a training session as well, so we will be teaching you several things during this time and sharing a host of knowledge that will help you over the next month.
- When bringing your puppy for their first day of board-training, they will almost immediately know where they are. Well, at least the people and dogs they are about to meet. Since they smelled us, during the evaluation, they will most certainly smell those same smells when entering our yard. This makes formal introductions with the other dogs fair less stressful and allows for your dog to just blend right in with the rest of the pack.
