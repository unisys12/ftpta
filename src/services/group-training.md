This offering is where we work with a group of owners/handlers and their canines. Classes will be keep to no more than 6 in a single class. Each class should last between one hour to one and half hours at the most and will be held on Saturdays at the following times:

- 10 AM (6 months and below)
- 12 PM (7 months - 1 year)
- 2 PM (over one year)

All classes will be following [AKC STAR Puppy](https://www.akc.org/products-services/training-programs/canine-good-citizen/akc-star-puppy/) and [CGC - _(Canine Good Citizen)_](https://www.akc.org/products-services/training-programs/canine-good-citizen/take-the-test/) course materials, homework and guidelines.

My goal is that at the end of the 6 classes, each owner and their canine will be evaluated to receive the AKC STAR Puppy and AKC Canine Good Citizen awards. For more information about the classes or to sign up, please fill out the this form with your contact info, your puppies name and breed. I will get in touch with you as soon as possible.
