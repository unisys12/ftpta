Bringing a new puppy into your home can be very overwhelming. There are so many questions. So many things that you might not have thought about. Sometimes you just don't know where to start. Other times, things are going great and you just want to give your puppy the best head start in life that you can, but you don't know exactly how to go about it. Both of these scenario's can be solved by enrolling your new family member into FTPTA's Puppy Program.

## Skills
During this 4 week program your puppy will come live with our family, in our home, with our 5 personal dogs, 3 cats and up to 3 other boarding pups. During there time here, they will learn and experience all the following:

- House training
- Crate training
- Basic Obedience Commands
    - Sit
    - Down
    - Up
    - Stand
    - Stay
    - Wait
    - Come
    - Place
    - Leave it
- Leash Walking
- Basic Manners
    - Biting
    - Jumping
    - Proper Play with others
- Early Socialization & Desensitization

It's vital that we maintain the bond between you and your puppy. It's also important that you, as your puppies owner, learn along with your new friend. For these reasons, we require that you attend at least one 1 hour training session with your puppy each week during their time here. This not only allows you to spend time with your pet, but get an in-person view of their training progress. It also gives us a chance to help instruct you on how to use the commands that we are teaching your puppy and properly communicate with your new family member. Some clients choose to take their puppies home over the weekends, which we are perfectly ok with.

## Precautions
Your puppy is _very_ vulnerable during this early stage of their development. With that in mind, we take every precaution necessary to protect your puppy. Including the list of requirements above. Since they are most likely not _fully vaccinated_ during at least part of their time here, we will not walk your puppy on the road or allow them to touch the ground outside of our yard. During the third week, we will take your puppy to town with us, but will carry it every where it goes. We want it to get as much early socialization as safely possible. If we feel that we cannot do this safely, we will notify you and we will work together to come up with a new plan of action to socialize your puppy.
