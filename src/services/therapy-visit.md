# Volunteer Therapy Visits

Volunteer therapy visits consist of me brining one of my _in-training_ therapy dogs to your place of business or organization, free of charge. We will come to your facility _(within a 50 mile radius of Corinth, MS)_ and tour your said facility for an average of 1 hr.
Although it is possible to stay longer than the 1 hr limit, we like to keep our _in-training_ visits capped to 1 hr. This is due to fact that the puppy or dog brought during the visit is currently in training and this keeps the puppy from becoming overwhelmed or overly uncomfortable. Also, during the first visit or two, we like to keep the puppy to patient interactions to a minimum. After the puppy and patients gain more confidence, we will introduce more interactions with each visit.
